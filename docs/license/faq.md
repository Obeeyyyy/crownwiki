Should any questions regarding the license system come up. Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/bJQRV5GeZg) and ask for help.

## General Information

- You **do not need a port** to whitelist a server IP address.
- Some game server hosts do **not show your real IP address**.  
  In this case, please contact us so we can whitelist your server for you.
- An **invalid license key does NOT disable** our plugins.  
  If a plugin is disabled, it has another cause.
- You are **not allowed to share** your license key with other people or projects.

## How do I get my license key?

Open a **license ticket** in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/bJQRV5GeZg) and provide the following information:

- Your BuiltByBit username
- The plugin you purchased

## Where do I find my license key?

Use `/license` in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/bJQRV5GeZg).  
You will find your license key in the embed message that is sent.

If you do not have a key yet, create a license ticket and ask for one.

## How do I whitelist my server on my license key?

1. Use `/license` in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/bJQRV5GeZg).
2. Click the **Manage Servers** button.
3. Enter your server’s **IP address** (not a domain).

   An IP address looks like this:  
   `80.166.4.321`

4. If you want to whitelist multiple IP addresses, separate them with a comma:

   `80.166.4.321,80.166.4.322`

5. Click **Save** and reload the plugin. A server restart is not required.

## My license key is not working

First, check if the plugin is enabled.

- If it is **not enabled**, continue here:  
  [How to install a plugin 101](how-to-install-a-plugin-101)

Then reload the plugin and check the console output.

- If you **do not see any message** stating that the license key is invalid, then your license key is working.
- If you **do see a message**, check the reason and continue below.

### How do i reset my license key ?
* To reset your license key, you will need to use the /license command in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/bJQRV5GeZg).
* Then press the "**Reset License**" button. 
* Confirm the action by typing "**YES**" and press "**Submit**".
* This will generate a new license key for you.

### Reasons why your license key might not work

#### Invalid server

This means your server is **not whitelisted** on your license key.

Follow the instructions above to whitelist your server.

Make sure you are using the **server IP address**, not your panel URL or domain.


#### Invalid key

This means the license key found in your `config.yml` is **incorrect**.

Retrieve your license key from our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/bJQRV5GeZg) again and update the value in the config.
