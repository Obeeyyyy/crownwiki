### What these values mean
* `prefix`: This is the prefix that is used in all our plugins with `%prefix%` in the message files and `%cc_prefix%` using [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/).
* `white`: This is the default color that is used in all our plugins with `%white%` in the message files and `%cc_white%` using [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/).
* `accent`: This is the accent color that is used in all our plugins with `%accent%` in the message files and `%cc_accent%` using [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/).

:::info
You can configure plugin specific values for what is mentioned above by simply adding them into the plugins `messages.yml` and using `%pluginname_key%` instead of `%key%`.
`Example:` `%crownkits_prefix%` will use the `prefix` defined in the `messages.yml` from `CrownKits` instead of the Cores.
